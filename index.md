We will utilise Scrum and Trello in many of our group work projects. 

This page provides further information on both Scrum and the Production journal required for assessment. 

## What is Scrum?

> Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. 

[The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

We know group work can be really bad, but it can also be really good. Either way, when you start working in the industry it is highly likely that you'll be working on projects in groups (or teams as they say now). We'll use Scrum as a framework for managing those process of development. 


## What is Trello?

> Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

> Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like BitBucket or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone, and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello!

## How does it work?
In our version of Scrum, there are 3 key components:

*   The backlog
*   Sprints
*   Scrum roles

When you start the project, you need to seed a backlog and define the Scrum roles. You'll then split the backlog into 'sprints', which you'll complete. 


Read this great [Beginner's guide to Scrum (from Trello)](https://blog.trello.com/beginners-guide-scrum-and-agile-project-management) which includes some great examples. 


## Backlog

In the simplest definition the Scrum backlog is simply a list of all things that needs to be done within the project. You'll use Trello for the backlog. 

These items can have a technical nature or can be user-centric e.g. in the form of user stories. The owner of the  backlog is the Product Owner. The Scrum Master and others contribute it to have a broad and complete To-Do list.

## Sprints

A sprint is predetermined timeframe in which you'll complete tasks from the backlog. The length of time for each sprint is determined by the team, gnerally it'd be 2 weeks, but for our purposes, you might shorten it to a week - or even just a number of days. 

For example, if you had 4 weeks to complete the project, you might complete two “sprints” of two weeks each – one to bring the project to a base level of functionality, and the second to refine and add polish.

## Scrum roles
Each person in the team is responsible for at least one of the following roles:

*   Product Owner
*   Scrum Master
*   Developer 

Note that there may be some cross over on the roles in our situation. 

### Product Owner

The product owner is a project's key stakeholder. Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the rest of the team.

The Product Owner is not allowed to be the scrum master or vice versa, but apart from that there are no restriction on roles. All team members can be developers (and all team members probably will need to develop to contribute enough), but allocation of work should take into account the additional work involved with being the Product Owner or Scrum Master

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is running the show - essentially they are the team coach.

The Scrum Master does anything possible to help the team perform at their highest level. This involves removing any impediments to progress, facilitating meetings, and doing things like working with the product owner to make sure the backlog is in good shape and ready for the next sprint.

## Developer

Self explanatory!

## Other roles
Depending on the complexity of the project, you may have other roles, e.g. designer, front-end developer, back-end developer etc.
