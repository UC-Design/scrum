We will utilise Scrum and Trello in many of our group work projects. 

This page provides further information on both Scrum and the Production journal required for assessment. 

## What is Scrum?

> Scrum is a framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. 

[The Scrum Guide](https://www.scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html)

We know group work can be really bad, but it can also be really good. Either way, when you start working in the industry it is highly likely that you'll be working on projects in groups (or teams as they say now). We'll use Scrum as a framework for managing those process of development. 


## What is Trello?

> Trello is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

> Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like BitBucket or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone, and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello!

## How does it work?
In our version of Scrum, there are 3 key components:

*   The backlog
*   Sprints
*   Scrum roles

When you start the project, you need to seed a backlog and define the Scrum roles. You'll then split the backlog into 'sprints', which you'll complete. 


Read this great [Beginner's guide to Scrum (from Trello)](https://blog.trello.com/beginners-guide-scrum-and-agile-project-management) which includes some great examples. 


## Backlog

In the simplest definition the Scrum backlog is simply a list of all things that needs to be done within the project. You'll use Trello for the backlog. 

These items can have a technical nature or can be user-centric e.g. in the form of user stories. The owner of the  backlog is the Product Owner. The Scrum Master and others contribute it to have a broad and complete To-Do list.

## Sprints

A sprint is predetermined timeframe in which you'll complete tasks from the backlog. The length of time for each sprint is determined by the team, gnerally it'd be 2 weeks, but for our purposes, you might shorten it to a week - or even just a number of days. 

For example, if you had 4 weeks to complete the project, you might complete two “sprints” of two weeks each – one to bring the project to a base level of functionality, and the second to refine and add polish.

## Scrum roles
Each person in the team is responsible for at least one of the following roles:

*   Product Owner
*   Scrum Master
*   Developer 

Note that there may be some cross over on the roles in our situation. 

### Product Owner

The product owner is a project's key stakeholder. Part of the product owner responsibilities is to have a vision of what he or she wishes to build, and convey that vision to the rest of the team.

The Product Owner is not allowed to be the scrum master or vice versa, but apart from that there are no restriction on roles. All team members can be developers (and all team members probably will need to develop to contribute enough), but allocation of work should take into account the additional work involved with being the Product Owner or Scrum Master

### Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is running the show - essentially they are the team coach.

The Scrum Master does anything possible to help the team perform at their highest level. This involves removing any impediments to progress, facilitating meetings, and doing things like working with the product owner to make sure the backlog is in good shape and ready for the next sprint.

## Developer

Self explanatory!

# Production Journal

Each team member needs to submit an individual report. The purpose of this report is to provide us with insight into your project, and particularly, into your participation as a member of the group. The report should be 750-1000 words in length, but you will not be penalised if you go over this.
 
You are **STRONGLY** encouraged to use screenshots, sketches, or other work products to help illustrate and define your contribution to the group. The goal is to show us a picture of you as a member of the team: 

*   were you a solid contributor, a leader, or someone who contributed what they could, when asked? 
*   Did you come to all the team meetings and what did you contribute to each? 
*   What did you actually do to help the team achieve the final project? 

This is where any documentation you created during the project comes in. It’s easy to say “I did my fair share”, but how can you prove that? Proof might be anything such as entries in a personal production journal, records or minutes of team meetings, contributions to Trello, or a log of commits to GitHub or some other kind of online version control system. 

If you don’t have any of this, then you should be really clear about the precise nature of the work you contributed. You won’t be marked just on what you claimed to have done, but on the evidence that backs up those claims.
