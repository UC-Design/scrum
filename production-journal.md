# Production Journal

Each team member needs to submit an individual report. The purpose of this report is to provide us with insight into your project, and particularly, into your participation as a member of the group. The report should be 750-1000 words in length, but you will not be penalised if you go over this.
 
You are STRONGLY encouraged to use screenshots, sketches, or other work products to help illustrate and define your contribution to the group. The goal is to show us a picture of you as a member of the team: 

*   were you a solid contributor, a leader, or someone who contributed what they could, when asked? 
*   Did you come to all the team meetings and what did you contribute to each? 
*   What did you actually do to help the team achieve the final project? 

This is where any documentation you created during the project comes in. It’s easy to say “I did my fair share”, but how can you prove that? Proof might be anything such as entries in a personal production journal, records or minutes of team meetings, contributions to Trello, or a log of commits to GitHub or some other kind of online version control system. If you don’t have any of this, then you should be really clear about the precise nature of the work you contributed. You won’t be marked just on what you claimed to have done, but on the evidence that backs up those claims.
